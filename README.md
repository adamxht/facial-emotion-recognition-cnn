Using a Facial Emotion Recognition image dataset with 7 classes of emotions which we gathered from Kaggle, our team has trained our custom CNN as well as perform Transfer Learning on popular image classification models such as MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 following a classical Machine Learning lifecycle. Finally our best model (Our custom CNN), have achieved an accuracy of 65% which is the same as human level's accuracy.
